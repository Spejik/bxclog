## Javascript

Install with npm:  
`npm install bxclog`

Example code:

```js
const { BXCLog } = require("bxclog");

/**
 * This BXCLog instance should be stored in a file like "lib.js" 
 * in the exports object.
 * You can save a lot of performance and resources by doing that, 
 * because creating new instances every time you need to log 
 * something will have a negative impact on performance
 */
const bxclogger = new BXCLog({
    saveToFile: true,
    brackets:   "<>",
});

const service = "CatsService";
bxclogger.debug("process.argv", process.argv);
bxclogger.info(service, "purr... meow, meow!", "we think the number", Math.random(), "is really cool... meow üò∫");
bxclogger.warn(service, 
  "The cats are hungry", "\n", "You better go feed them right now \n", 
  "They also said that they need exactly this many kilos of food:", 68429796945127451n, "...it should be enough for about one and a half days üòº");
bxclogger.error(service, "The cats are really hungry and are starting to delete your programs üò† Go feed them right now üöîüëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è");
```

## Typescript

Install with npm:

`npm install bxclog`

Example code:

```ts
import { BXCLog } from "bxclog";

/**
 * You can copy the rest of the code from Javascript, 
 * The only difference is that instead of the "exports" object you use es6 export ("export const bxclogger = ...")
 */
```

## CPP

Note: Has been tested only with Visual Studio 2019

Install by cloning the repository into a directory like `deps` in your solution

`git clone https://github.com/Spejik/bxclog.git`

Then you need to include the repo as a project and set it as a Static Library.

Next, add the following directories into the compiler... or you know what, the code for C++ isn't even completed, so just don't do it yet üôÇ These are just notes for me so I know what to put here üòÉ
